This post-build action updates an Integrity project or subproject with the results of the build.
<p>
In order to update an Integrity project or subproject that is configured with mandatory or transactional change packages, you must configure builds with 'parameters'.
The parameter name 'ItemID' must contain the Integrity Item ID that allows an open change package.  If the build is not configured with the 'ItemID' parameter, then the plugin considers the value for the change package as ':none'.
With build parameters enabled, builds can be triggered remotely using the URL: 'http://server/job/myjob/buildWithParameters?token=TOKEN&ItemID=1234'.
</p>
<p>	
This check-in task <b>does not</b> create sub projects recursively.  This action does not do a recursive project tree update. The contents from a single "build output" directory is updated back in an Integrity project or subproject.
</p>
<p> 
The plugin applies the Ant-style include/exclude filters (example: "foo/*.zip" or "foo/**/*.xml") recursively to files and folders in the single "build output" directory.
